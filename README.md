# Estimate-cetane-number-of-Diesel-fuel
Your task for this dataset is to see whether it is possible or not to estimate the cetane number for diesel fuel from the near infrared spectrum for the fuel. There is a total of 245 observations. You receive 133 of these for training and validation, and 112 are kept for testing. You are given the file cnDieselTrain.mat, which contains three matrices: cn-TrainX (401 × 133), cnTrainY (1 × 133), and cnTestX (401 × 112). The first matrix (cnTrainX) contains the IR-spectrum for each sample, one column per sample. The second matrix (cnTrainY) contains the output value cetane number for each diesel fuel. The third matrix (cnTestX) contains the input (IR-spectra) for each sample in the test data set. The spectrum has 401 channels (features), and the data must first be reduced in dimensionality, e.g. by transforming to a principal component basis (which is how it is done in the commercial application) or by selecting appropriate features.
